# Sample Without Keys

This document contains wallet-related keywords but no actual seed phrases or private keys.

## Wallet Information

I use several cryptocurrency wallets including:
- Metamask for Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens
- Solflare for Solana
- Exodus as a multi-coin wallet

You should always keep your wallet passphrase safe and secure.

Never share your private key with anyone.

Seed phrases are usually 12 or 24 words long.

## Security Tips

- Keep your recovery phrase offline
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Regularly update your wallet software
